# Pixel Art Maker

This is a Pixel Art Maker project that allows you to create pixel art drawings. You can access the live version of the project [here](https://shannonscotta.github.io/pixel-art-maker/).

## Design Inspiration

The project's design was inspired by the following design:

## How to Use

1. Open the [live version](https://shannonscotta.github.io/pixel-art-maker/).
2. Use the color palette to select colors.
3. Click on individual pixels in the grid to paint them with the selected color.
4. Use the hamburger menu to access the following options:
   - Eraser: Select the eraser tool to remove colors from the canvas.
   - Pencil: Choose the pencil tool for precise drawing.
   - Paint Brush: Use the paintbrush tool for broader strokes.
   - Clear: This option allows you to clear the entire canvas and start fresh.
   - Save: Save your pixel art creations using the local storage feature.

## Features

- Event listeners: The project utilizes event listeners to enable users to interact with the pixel grid, changing colors and creating art.
- Local Storage: Pixel art creations can be saved and retrieved using local storage, allowing users to continue their work later.
- Hamburger Menu: A responsive hamburger menu with CSS transitions enhances the user experience.

## Learning Points

Throughout the development of this project, I gained experience and knowledge in the following areas:

- Implementing event listeners to capture user interactions.
- Utilizing local storage to store and retrieve data within the browser.
- Creating a responsive hamburger menu with CSS transitions for improved navigation.
